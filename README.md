# React & Apollo Tutorial

This is the sample project that belongs to the [React & Apollo Tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/0-introduction/) on How to GraphQL.

## How to use

### 1. Clone repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/howtographql/react-apollo/
```

### 2. Install dependencies & Deploy the Prisma database API

To install the Prisma CLI globally with Yarn, use the following command:
```sh
yarn global add prisma
```

Also, run the following commands:
```sh
cd react-apollo/server
yarn install
prisma generate
```

 <summary>Alternative: Run Prisma locally via Docker</summary>

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, you can get it from [here](https://store.docker.com/search?offering=community&type=edition).
1. Create `docker-compose.yml` for MySQL (see [here](https://www.prisma.io/docs/prisma-server/database-connector-POSTGRES-jgfr/) for Postgres):
    ```yml
    version: '3'
    services:
      prisma:
        image: prismagraphql/prisma:1.23
        restart: always
        ports:
        - "4466:4466"
        environment:
          PRISMA_CONFIG: |
            port: 4466
            databases:
              default:
                connector: mysql
                host: mysql
                port: 3306
                user: root
                password: prisma
                migrations: true
      mysql:
        image: mysql:5.7
        restart: always
        environment:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: prisma
        volumes:
          - mysql:/var/lib/mysql
    volumes:
      mysql:
    ```
1. Run `docker-compose up -d`
1. Run `prisma deploy`

</details>

### 3. Start the server

To start the server, all you need to do is execute the `start` script by running the following command inside the `server` directory:

```sh
yarn start
```

> **Note**: If you want to interact with the GraphQL API of the server inside a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground), you can navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

### 4. Run the app

Now that the server is running, you can start the React app as well. The commands need to be run in a new terminal tab/window inside the root directory `react-apollo` (because the current tab is blocked by the process running the server):

```sh
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can now open your browser and use the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
